### Explanation:
1. **TaskTracker Class**: This class manages the tasks, including loading from and saving to a JSON file.
2. **Methods**:
   - `load_tasks()`: Loads tasks from a JSON file.
   - `save_tasks()`: Saves the current list of tasks to a JSON file.
   - `add_task(task)`: Adds a new task to the list.
   - `remove_task(task)`: Removes a task from the list.
   - `list_tasks()`: Lists all current tasks.
3. **Main Loop**: The script runs a simple command-line interface that allows users to add, remove, and list tasks.

### Usage:
- Save the above code in a file named `tracker.py`.
- Run the script using Python: `python tracker.py`.
- Follow the prompts to manage your tasks.

Feel free to modify the code to suit your specific needs or to add additional features! If you have specific functionalities from `tracker.ipynb` that you want to include, please provide more details, and I can help tailor the script accordingly.
